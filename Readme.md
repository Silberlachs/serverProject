# MultiPage

Multipage is a Shellscript that aims in helping you setting up multipage websites.
I made it because I found it really cumbersome to manually edit VHOSTs and create
all the folder structures

## Installation

Put the script into your /bin folder to make it accessible from the command line.
!!! Always be carefull when installing software this way !!!

You can use this line to install it from your downloads folder:
```bash
sudo chmod u+x multipage && mv multipage /bin/multipage
```

## Usage

```shell

# call with XYZ
TODO: Write an explanation


```
