# MultiPage

Multipage is a Shellscript that aims in helping you setting up multipage websites.
I made it because I found it really cumbersome to manually edit VHOSTs and create
all the folder structures

## Requirements

An Ubuntu 20.04 server with a non-root user with sudo privileges. You can use our Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04 guide to set this up.

Apache installed on the server. You can learn how by completing steps 1-3 on our How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 20.04 tutorial.


## Installation

Put the script into your /bin folder to make it accessible from the command line.
!!! Always be carefull when installing software this way !!!

You can use this line to install it from your downloads folder:
```bash
sudo chmod u+x multipage && mv multipage /bin/multipage
```

## Usage

```shell

# call with XYZ
TODO: Write an explanation


```
